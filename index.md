## Frist Post!

Ok if you understand the title of this post you are officially old. Welcome to this blog. It will probably die. But I will try to post the things I learn so I can share the knowledge and hopefully people searching for weird niche issues can find solutions.

I really need to thank Chrissy LeMaire ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/cl), [Github](https://github.com/potatoqualitee)) for encouraging me to create this blog and honestly so many other things.

### What to expect

I work with a lot of different tech. Currently I am on a team building a small domain. I deal with everything from storage to VMware to Active Directory and really all things in between. This project is pushing me to learn all of those things and how they interact with eachother. It also is pushing me to learn more about things that I have ignored such as networking.

Anyway, my next post is most likely about vSphere. Hopefully it helps someone.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/luzkenin/jsph.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/luzkenin/jsph.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
