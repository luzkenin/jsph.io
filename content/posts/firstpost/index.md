Ok if you understand the title of this post you are officially old. Welcome to this blog. It will probably die. But I will try to post the things I learn so I can share the knowledge and hopefully people searching for weird niche issues can find solutions.

I really need to thank Chrissy LeMaire ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/cl), [Github](https://github.com/potatoqualitee)) for encouraging me to create this blog and honestly so many other things.

### What to expect

I work with a lot of different tech. Currently I am on a team building a small domain. I deal with everything from storage to VMware to Active Directory and really all things in between. This project is pushing me to learn all of those things and how they interact with eachother. It also is pushing me to learn more about things that I have ignored such as networking.

Anyway, my next post is most likely about vSphere. Hopefully it helps someone.
